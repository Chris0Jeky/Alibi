## 7 October 2026: cabinet fallback safety candidate

Base main: `cde5f56cb02dea6471972a1fe85b0724a01e75a5`.
This branch is an unmerged candidate, not a published release or deployment.
The prior state is preserved byte-for-byte in
[STATE-BEFORE-STORAGE-READONLY-2026-10-07.md](STATE-BEFORE-STORAGE-READONLY-2026-10-07.md)
using its existing Git blob `c52c61ed95817ef9f343530271515efdeeafb3e0`.
Its historical release evidence and older lane notes remain available there.

Refs #554. The candidate takes the issue's explicit fail-closed option:
localStorage cabinet run writes are read-only, even with Web Locks. Reads,
export, old/future records and the existing error surface remain. Session CAS
compares and writes without an intervening await; IndexedDB remains unchanged.
The application retains its existing first-save-error behavior, rather than
adding an implicit session overlay or a new durable save owner.

The new source suite reproduces 17 failures and one passing control on the old
storage, then passes all 18 after repair. The 35-case storage/revision/restore/
recovery/update selection passes, retaining 58 legacy assertions with explicit
local-write expectation changes. Browser wiring adds two passing cases.
Local dependencies and native navigation remain unavailable; no local full
build or browser pass is claimed. Exact-head CI, all unchanged byte ceilings,
52 native/emitted-app scenarios, independent review and aging are merge gates.
The first CI receipt and bootstrap-size repair are recorded in the QA note;
the storage owner remains eager and fully counted in the existing bootstrap.
Details: [storage policy and evidence](qa/STORAGE-READONLY-2026-10-07.md).

## Related work, not implicitly qualified

- #585 has a retained native two-success counterexample. A later diagnostic-only
  green run did not change the storage implementation and is not a repair.
  This candidate is based directly on main, not on #585 or its parent #581.
- #581's offline navigation has separate current-base, browser and review gates.
- #593's bounded attempted-domain rollback repair does not qualify #579's
  multi-domain save transfer. Same-domain concurrency, semantic validation and
  inherited parent budget increases remain separate blockers.
- Main already includes #587's mobile QA startup/diagnostics and #589's fixture
  AbortError ordering changes. Their merges are source landings, not a new
  deployment or physical-device acceptance claim.

## Preserved human and release boundaries

[HUMAN_TODO.md](../HUMAN_TODO.md) remains authoritative for physical Android,
TalkBack, publishing, origin and other owner gates. No database version,
published puzzle identity, numerical budget or production deployment is changed.
Use the exact current PR head and its artifacts rather than historic counts
when qualifying a merge. Do not discard the previous state or failed receipts.

### Block Cabinet phone action hierarchy candidate, 2026-09-17

The historical candidate and proving checks remain in the linked gameplay-base archive;
physical Android touch, TalkBack, comfort review and human acceptance stay open.
Neither newer source proofs nor browser screenshots turn that candidate into a device signoff.
